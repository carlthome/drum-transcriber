%TRANSCRIBEDRUMS Recognize drums in a song.
%   Given an audio file of a song featuring drums, and trained pattern
%   recognition models, the likeliest transcript of drums is returned by
%   extracting features from the audio file and comparing short observation
%   sequences of said features per drum. Each drum has a sound-model and a
%   silence-model and the likeliest model to have produced the sequence
%   determines if the drum was triggered or not.
%   
%   Optional: smoothing (a float from 0.0 to 1.0) determines how much time
%   smoothing should be applied to each drum hit. A smoothed time is a
%   weighted average of close drum hits, where the weights come from the
%   certainty of a drum hit, calculated as the difference between the
%   forward probabilities of the sound and silence model.
