MIRtoolbox requires Matlab version 7 and Mathworks' Signal Processing toolbox.

**

This distribution actually includes four different toolboxes:

- the MIRtoolbox itself, version 1.5,

- the Auditory toolbox, version 2, by Malcolm Slaney
(also available directly at http://cobweb.ecn.purdue.edu/~malcolm/interval/1998-010/),

- the Netlab toolbox, version 3.3, by Ian Nabney
(also available directly at http://www.ncrg.aston.ac.uk/netlab/)

- the SOM toolbox, version 2.0, by Esa Alhoniemi, Johan Himberg, Jukka Parviainen and Juha Vesanto
(also available directly at http://www.cis.hut.fi/projects/somtoolbox/)

**

MIRtoolbox license is based on GPL 2.0. As such, it can integrate codes from other GPL 2.0 projects, as long as their origins are explicitly stated.
- codes from the Music Analysis Toolbox by Elias Pampalk (2004), related to the computation of Terhardt outer ear modeling, Bark band decomposition and masking effects.

- openbdf and readbdf script by T.S. Lorig to read BDF files, based on openedf and readedf by Alois Schloegl,

- implementation of Earth Mover Distance written by Yossi Rubner and wrapped for Matlab by Elias Pampalk.

Code integrated with BSD license:
- mp3read for Matlab by Dan Ellis, which calls the mpg123 decoder and the mp3info scanner,
- aiffread for Matlab by Kenneth Eaton.

To install MIRtoolbox in your Matlab environment, copy all the toolboxes folders (or only those that are not installed yet in your computer) into your Matlab "toolbox" folder. Then add each folder in your Matlab path.

**

NOTICE: If you replace an older version of MIRtoolbox with a new one, please update your Matlab path using the following command:
rehash toolboxcache
Update also the class structure of the toolbox, either by restarting Matlab, or by typing the following command:
clear classes

**

To get an overview of the functions available in the toolbox, type:
help mirtoolbox

A complete documentation in PDF is provided in the main toolbox folder. For absolute Matlab beginners, we suggest to read MIRtoolboxPrimer.

A short documentation for each function is available directly in Matlab using the help command. For instance: help miraudio

Examples of use of the toolbox are shown in the MIRToolboxDemos folder:
