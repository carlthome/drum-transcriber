This is the Matlab Auditory Toolbox.  Version 2.

First published by Apple Computer as Apple Technical Report #45.  This
new version is published by Interval Research Corporation as TR #1998-010.

I have put this collection of code together to support my own research.  I
hope by adding documentation and testing everything that other researchers
can also benefit from this work.

Needless to say, support is limited.  I use this code, so I am interested
in hearing bug reports.  I'll fix them if I can reproduce them and I have
the time.  But no guarantees.  Sending bug fixes is a good way to make sure
I pay attention.

This archive contains ".m" files, some Matlab mex files, and the C sources
needed to create the mex files.  I have tested this code on Macintosh, PC,
SGI, and Sun computers running Matlab 5.2.  The code is reasonably 
portable, so I don't expect any problems on any machine running Matlab.

After installing this software on your machine, use the test_auditory
script to run through the examples in the documentation.
