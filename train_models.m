function models = train_models(patternDirectory)
%TRAIN_MODELS Go through the given directory with patterns and train
% models on the patterns.
%   The pattern directory is expected to contain training data for the drum
%   detector models. A pattern should be an audio file and a corresponding
%   MIDI file with information about exactly when which drum is being
%   played. MIDI files should follow the GM standard. Note: multiple drums
%   across a combined MIDI file will be combined. The drum detector models
%   are as follows: per drum to be recognized, one four-state left-to-right
%   Hidden Markov Model (HMM) recognizes if the drum has been triggered.
%   One 5-component Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) detects when the drum is
%   silent. Deciding if a particular drum has been triggered or not in
%   subsequent test data can be determined by comparing the forward
%   probability of the HMM with the GMM. If the HMM has the higher
%   probability the drum has likely been triggered in the observation
%   sequence.
